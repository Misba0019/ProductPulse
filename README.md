## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start MongoDB (if not running automatically)
MongoDB must be running for the app to work. If itâ€™s not running automatically, start it manually:
```bash
mongod
```

### 3. Seed the Database (Optional)
To populate your database with sample products, run:
```bash
node seeds.js
```
> This will clear any existing products and insert fresh seed data.

### 4. Start the Server
```bash
nodemon index.js
```
> If you donâ€™t have nodemon installed globally, you can install it with `npm install -g nodemon`,
or simply run `node index.js` instead.
> To stop the server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000/products](http://localhost:3000/products).
